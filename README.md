It is completely open-source and uses the following technologies:

This is my pipeline, the first step of this pipeline is to ingest userâ€™s input
So user can submit their movie reviews from the website. 
These reviews will be transformed to a json message and be sent to Kafka. I have a consumer job to save these messages from Kafka to S3.
And combining these reviews with all the historical reviews from amazon dataset.
I can train my collaborative filtering model with my spark cluster. Spark machine learning library currently use a model based alternating least squares algorithm to learn latent factor and predict missing movie ratings for the users. The model will be saved to S3 and estimated ratings will be saved to cassandra.
Then my web frontend will be querying cassandra to get movie recommendations for our users.
